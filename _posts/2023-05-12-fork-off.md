Have you ever tested a Linux application that forks into multiple processes?
Isn't it a pain? Whether you're debugging, trying to see a process crash, or
trying to write an exploit, it can be super duper annoying!

In a few days, I'm giving a talk at NorthSec in Montreal. I asked some
co-workers to review my slides, and they commented that I have some neat
techniques to deal with forking, so I thought I'd share a couple!

Spoiler alert: The last one is the best, so you can just skip to that. :)

## Targets

I wrote two simple apps, one that forks and one that doesn't. I'll hopefully
remember to edit in a GitHub repo for them later - and did! You can grab
them [here](https://github.com/iagox86/forktest)! I included everything else
I use for this blog, as well.

To check out the project and follow along, go ahead and clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/iagox86/forktest.git

Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.

$ cd forktest
```

I've included built versions of all the files, but they aren't built to be
portable so they might not work cleanly. If you need to build them yourself,
I've included a basic Makefile:

```
$ make clean && make
rm -f *.o forkapp noforkapp onlyyoucanpreventforking.so patch
gcc -g -Wall -fno-stack-protector -o forkapp forkapp.c
gcc -g -Wall -fno-stack-protector -o noforkapp noforkapp.c
gcc -shared -fPIC -o onlyyoucanpreventforking.so onlyyoucanpreventforking.c
nasm -o patch patch.asm
```

This should work more or less the same on any 64-bit Intel Linux system.

## The problem

When you run either test app, it copies the first argument into a string
(unsafely) then prints it to the screen:

```
$ ./forkapp test
You entered: test
```

Let's say you want to use `strace` to view system calls. In a process that
prints a string, you'd expect to see a call to `write` or something similar,
which is the system call that writes to, say, stdout (your terminal). Here's
what it looks like without forking:

```
$ strace ./noforkapp test
execve("./noforkapp", ["./noforkapp", "test"], 0x7fffd7acc8f8 /* 72 vars */) = 0

[...]

write(1, "You entered: test\n", 18You entered: test
)     = 18
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

But once you add forking into the equation, you no longer see the `write`
syscall in `strace` by default:

```
$ strace ./forkapp test
execve("./forkapp", ["./forkapp", "test"], 0x7ffd1b7f02c8 /* 52 vars */) = 0

[...]

clone(child_stack=NULL, flags=CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID|CLONE_CHILD_SETTID|SIGCHLD, child_tidptr=0x7f82376b4a10) = 133314
wait4(133314, You entered: test
NULL, 0, NULL)            = 133314
--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=133314, si_uid=1000, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

We see the string, but that's all!

Likewise, if we overflow the stack, we should get some sorta feedback like
this:

```
$ ./noforkapp AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
You entered: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
fish: Job 1, './noforkapp AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA…' terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)
```

But when it forks, we get nothing:

```
$ ./forkapp AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
You entered: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
$
```

If you know to look in `dmesg` or `journalctl`, they should catch the crash, but
it's so easy to forget that:

```
$ dmesg | tail -n1
[1034540.509003] traps: forkapp[133518] general protection fault ip:40120f sp:7ffd5e41b668 error:0 in forkapp[401000+1000]

$ journalctl | grep forkapp

[...]
May 12 13:06:50 ronlab kernel: traps: forkapp[140097] general protection fault ip:40120f sp:7ffd5e41b668 error:0 in forkapp[401000+1000]
[...]
```

So basically, forking is a pain when reverse engineering, fuzzing, exploit
testing, and basically everything else. It's widely believe to have been a
mistake (at least by exploit devs).

## Technique 1: Explaining forking to your tools

The most common way to handle this, and also what I'd call the worst way (okay,
upon review, Technique 2 is worse), is by configuring your tools correctly. The
first problem with this is that it requires you to RTFM, which is something I'm
not a fan of. The second problem is that it's easy to forget, and then you miss
stuff.

`strace` has a `-f` or `--follow-forks` option, which will follow the child
processes:

```
$ strace -f ./forkapp test
execve("./forkapp", ["./forkapp", "test"], 0x7ffd203a57c0 /* 72 vars */) = 0

[...]

clone(child_stack=NULL, flags=CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID|CLONE_CHILD_SETTID|SIGCHLDstrace: Process 133742 attached
, child_tidptr=0x7fa1dfd5ca10) = 133742
[pid 133742] set_robust_list(0x7fa1dfd5ca20, 24) = 0
[pid 133741] wait4(133742,  <unfinished ...>

[...]

[pid 133742] write(1, "You entered: test\n", 18You entered: test
) = 18
[pid 133742] exit_group(0)              = ?
[pid 133742] +++ exited with 0 +++
<... wait4 resumed>NULL, 0, NULL)       = 133742
--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=133742, si_uid=1000, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

When the `-f` option is specified, you can once again see the `write` syscall!
If you're looking to see it crash, you can run the process in `gdb` and set
the `follow-fork-mode` option to `child`, which tells `gdb` to attach to the
first child process spawned:

```
$ gdb -q ./forkapp
Reading symbols from ./forkapp...
(gdb) set follow-fork-mode child
(gdb) run AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

0x000000000040120f in main (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffda98) at forkapp.c:27
27      }
```

That's great, but also a pain!

Surely there's a better way!

## Technique 2: Globally killing fork with `LD_PRELOAD`

I wanted to talk about using `LD_PRELOAD` for two reasons: first, it's a neat
technique that applies to a whole bunch of other stuff; second, I wanted to have
three techniques for a better blog title!

With the `LD_PRELOAD` environmental variable, you can override functions from
libraries with your own implementations! I wrote some CTF challenges last year
called `loadit`, which uses this technique; you can see writeups
[here](https://www.skullsecurity.org/2022/bsidessf-2022-writeups-tutorial-challenges-shurdles-loadit-polyglot-nft).

To implement `fork` yourself, you create your own program that defines your own
version of `fork` that does what you want - basically, nothing. It should
return `0`, which tells the process that `fork` worked and the process is the
`child` process. The fun part is, since we didn't actually fork, there *is* no
parent process!

Here's an empty `fork` implementation (which you can also grab from the repo):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

pid_t fork(void) {
  printf("The process tried to fork!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Here's the command to compile it:

```
$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o onlyyoucanpreventforking.so onlyyoucanpreventforking.c
```

Then set the environmental variable, and you can freely test the app:

```
$ export LD_PRELOAD=./onlyyoucanpreventforking.so

$ ./forkapp AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The process tried to fork!
You entered: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Until of course, tools fail to work. I'm testing this as I write, and both
`strace` and `gdb` seem to depend on forking. That means you have to specify
the `LD_PRELOAD` environmental variable for the child, but not the parent.
Sometimes that's easy, sometimes not.

Here's how you can use it with `strace`:

```
$ strace -E LD_PRELOAD=./onlyyoucanpreventforking.so ./forkapp test

[...]

write(1, "The process tried to fork!\n", 27The process tried to fork!
) = 27
write(1, "You entered: test\n", 18You entered: test
)     = 18
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

And `gdb`:

```
$ gdb -q ./forkapp
Reading symbols from ./forkapp...

(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./onlyyoucanpreventforking.so

(gdb) run AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Starting program: /home/ron/tmp/forktest/forkapp AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

0x000000000040120f in main (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffd8a8) at forkapp.c:27
27      }
```

Now that I am actually messing with this, it's kind of a terrible technique and
you probably shouldn't use it. Upon review, I'm calling this the worst of the
three techniques (but I refuse to re-order the blog!)

It's interesting, though!

## Technique 3: Kill it with fire (edit the binary)

My favourite technique is "burn it down". I edit the binary's hex code, and
literally remove the call to `fork()`. That sorta thing will fail on Windows,
because of how relocations work (see
[my writeup](https://www.skullsecurity.org/2022/bsidessf-2022-writeups-miscellaneous-challenges-loca-reallyprettymundane)
for the CTF challenge "loca"), but works great on Linux! Note that if the parent
process actually *does* something, this will fail in some spectacular way. Use
at your own peril. :)

### Disassembling

First, you want to disassemble the binary to find where `fork()` is called.
You can use whatever disassembler you're comfortable with; IDA or Ghidra are
common choices, but I'll use `objdump` since it's always handy on Linux.

When I run `objdump`, I pass two flags: `-M intel` to emit the more familiar
Intel syntax (default is AT&T, which you don't see much anymore); and `-d` to
disassemble the file.

Here's what the output looks like (note that it's quite long, so be prepared to
pipe into `grep` or `less` or redirect into a file you can search:

```
$ objdump -M intel -d ./forkapp | grep -C3 'fork'

[...]

  4011a6:       e8 a5 fe ff ff          call   401050 <fprintf@plt>
  4011ab:       bf 01 00 00 00          mov    edi,0x1
  4011b0:       e8 bb fe ff ff          call   401070 <exit@plt>
  4011b5:       e8 c6 fe ff ff          call   401080 <fork@plt>
  4011ba:       89 45 fc                mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
  4011bd:       83 7d fc 00             cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x0
  4011c1:       75 32                   jne    4011f5 <main+0x7f>

  [...]
```

Note that there might be more than one call to `fork` - if that's the case, you
can try replacing each one, or just replace all of them to see what happens!

The left-most column is the virtual address where the code will load - the
actual address doesn't matter, since it's not the in-file address, but as
far as I can tell there's no good way to get the in-file address with `objdump`
(although `--file-offsets` looked promising!). It will, however, share the last
4 digits with the in-file address, which can help disambiguate things.

The second column is the machine code - it's important to note how many bytes
the call to `fork` takes up, and which bytes they are so we can recognize them
later. It should always be 5 bytes, but the values will change in each app; in
our case, it's `e8 c6 fe ff ff`. You CANNOT add or subtract bytes without a
world of problems, so you're going to need to replace those five bytes with
something else that's exactly 5 bytes. That's super important!

### Building a patch

Now that we know we need to replace 5 bytes, and what the original bytes are,
but what do we replace them with?

There are lots of options, but let's use `nasm` to create the simplest patch
we can. Here's some 64-bit assembly code that simulates a function that does
nothing but returns 0 (not that since it's never actually called, we don't
actually have to return):

```
bits 64

mov rax, 0
```

We can assemble that with `nasm`, then use `hexdump` to check what it becomes:

```
$ nasm -o patch patch.asm
$ hexdump -C patch
00000000  b8 00 00 00 00                                    |.....|
00000005
```

It's handy that the naive solution is already 5 bytes! If you need to take up
more space, you can add `nop` (which is one byte - `90`) as many times as you want,
before or after the instruction. If you need to take up *less* space, you need
to get creative and find shorter ways to do things. Replacing `mov rax, 0` with
`xor rax, rax` is one such optimization.

### Insert the patch

We're going to literally change the binary to replace `call fork` with our
patch, using a hex editor! You can use whatever hex editor you like (I often
use `xvi32`, which is super old and janky). For demo purposes, I'll use `xxd`
to convert the binary to hex, and `xxd -r` to convert back.

To convert `forkapp` to hex using `xxd`, run `xxd` and redirect the binary into
it on stdin. I use `-g1` since that format is slightly more familiar to me:

```
$ xxd -g1 < forkapp > forkapp.hex
```

Then I open the file in whatever text editor I like, and find the 5 bytes that
we noted earlier - `e8 c6 fe ff ff`. Hopefully they should only appear once; if
they appear multiple times, look for an offset in the file that looks similar to
the offset in `objdump`. Here's what it looks like in `forkapp.hex`:

```
000011a0: c7 b8 00 00 00 00 e8 a5 fe ff ff bf 01 00 00 00  ................
000011b0: e8 bb fe ff ff*e8 c6 fe ff ff*89 45 fc 83 7d fc  ...........E..}.
000011c0: 00 75 32 48 8b 45 d0 48 83 c0 08 48 8b 10 48 8d  .u2H.E.H...H..H.
```

Replace those bytes with our patch - `b8 00 00 00 00`:

```
000011a0: c7 b8 00 00 00 00 e8 a5 fe ff ff bf 01 00 00 00  ................
000011b0: e8 bb fe ff ff b8 00 00 00 00 89 45 fc 83 7d fc  ...........E..}.
000011c0: 00 75 32 48 8b 45 d0 48 83 c0 08 48 8b 10 48 8d  .u2H.E.H...H..H.
```

Then use `xxd -r` to convert back to binary:

```
$ xxd -r < forkapp.hex > forkapp.patched
```

Optionally, disassemble again to ensure it worked:

```
$ objdump  -M intel -d forkapp.patched | grep -C2 '4011b5:'
  4011ab:       bf 01 00 00 00          mov    edi,0x1
  4011b0:       e8 bb fe ff ff          call   401070 <exit@plt>
  4011b5:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x0
  4011ba:       89 45 fc                mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
  4011bd:       83 7d fc 00             cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x0
```

### Go go go!

Then make the newly patched binary executable with `chmod +x`, and do your
testing:

```
$ chmod +x forkapp.patched 

$ ./forkapp.patched AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
You entered: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
fish: Job 1, './forkapp.patched AAAAAAAAAAAAA…' terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)

$ strace ./forkapp.patched test

[...]

write(1, "You entered: test\n", 18You entered: test
)     = 18
exit_group(0)                           = ?

$ gdb -q ./forkapp.patched 

(gdb) run AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[...]

You entered: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x000000000040120f in main (argc=2, argv=0x7fffffffda88) at forkapp.c:27
27      }
```

Pretty much everything will work as if there was never a fork!
